## Description

Kheridien's Revenge is a game developed for the course of Game Mechanics and Balancing of the Bachelor's program on Information Technology of the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte (UFRN). Godot, an open-source game engine, and GDScript, the engine's default language, were used for the development of the game. The game, in pre-alpha phase, participated in the EPoGames 2017 gaming festival (local).

The idea of the game arose from free sprites available on the internet, of zombies and a ninja. The game features a ninja, controlled by the player, with the objective to kill all the zombies that goes in their way.
